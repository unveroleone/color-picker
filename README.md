# ðŸŽ¨ Color Picker â€“ My First JavaScript Project

This is my first JavaScript project, built with minimal external help. It serves as a foundational step in my journey to mastering JavaScript.

## âœ¨ Features

- Enter **three numbers** (0â€“255) to define an RGB color.  
- The **background color** updates based on the input values.  
- **Clear function** to reset inputs and background.  
- **Copy to clipboard** feature for easy sharing of the selected color.  

## ðŸš€ Future Plans

This is just the beginning of my JavaScript journey. While it takes time to fully grasp and fluently apply JavaScript, I can already see progress. More projects will follow as I continue to improve!
